# This is an example repository for the "Web Programming " course at SUNY New Paltz

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the 'index.html' file in your browser.

Put your essay in an md file.
Two things that you don't want tracked in your GitHub:
anything that you didn't create 

1. Any secondary assets like your compiled code and libraries.
2. Any secret (like passwords).

Clicking + instead of committing will take the files that are staged (the ones you selected).

In gitignore.io, type the systems that you will be using:
1. VS code
2. Node
3. Vuejs
4. MacOS (if on Mac)

Copy what it generates then paste it into the .gitignore file.
If you delete the .(filetype) in the gitignore, the files won't be uploaded when committing.

Command to untrack files: git rm qqq.icloud

# Example Code

```typescript

```
